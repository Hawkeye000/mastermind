This file plays the codebreaker game "Mastermind"

Play by running "mastermind.rb" through the ruby interpreter.  You will type a 'code' of colors and watch the code be printed with appropriate feedback of how close you are to breaking it.

You will see a black peg for each color in a correct spot.
You will see a white peg for each color not in a correct spot, but present in the code.

Try to get all black pegs before 12 turns are up!
